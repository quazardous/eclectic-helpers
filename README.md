# eclectic-helpers
Various helpers I dont want to duplicate

# install
    composer require quazardous/eclectic-helpers

# doc
See code. You may like:
- RowsMapper in src/Transform: add dynamic fields to row or array of rows. Use it form Twig preparation stuff.
- ComplexType in src/Form: structured form type without form class.
- ZOutStream in src/Helper: on-the-fly zlib compression to web output (for downloads).

# context
Used in Silex 2 / Doctrine projects but may work somewhere else.

# dependencies
Dependencies are not required but suggested to avoid breaking projects not using all the helpers.
